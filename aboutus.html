    <center><p class="aboutustext">Thirty-five years ago, Donnie Ray Taylor went out to explore his love for horses. He traveled around different parts of Tennessee and met others who shared his interest, specifically farriers. Farriers are craftsmen who trim and shoe horses' hooves, these people became his mentors. They taught him the skills he needed to start his own business and keep it thriving! Donnie then had two sons with his beautiful wife, Geraldine, and Donnie passed on his knowledge to them. One of his sons, Spencer, went on racing horses while Christopher stayed in business. Spencer married a pretty wife named Stephanie, he is also expecting a son. Christopher went on to marry a gorgeous wife named Ebony and later became a father to three children. He also became his father's business partner, and together they keep horses' feet clean and healthy! Since they have excelled in this line of work, they were recoginzed by and made it to the cover of,"Our Jackson Home" in 2016. Also, inside there is an article that goes more in-depth about their work. </p></center>
